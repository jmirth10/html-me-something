            <h2>Team Travel</h2>
            <p>
                My trip started by meeting the entire team in Califorias LAX airport. The team and all the coaches met for the first time in this airport. We only had a short time to meet everyone while waiting for out flight but we would have plenty of time on our 18+ hour flight. We had almost the whole plane to ourselves. Both the men and womens teams were on the same flight with only a handful of random people. This made for a very relaxing flight as there was only 1 person to every 3 seats on the plane. After meeting everyone we were able to sleep for a few hours before ariving in Australia where it was 2 days later then when we left the US.

            <h2>The Down Under Cup</h2>
            <p>
                Our first stop was in Melbourne. The team was very excited to get their first win the morning after arriving. The rest of bracket play we only lost 1 game. We made it to the finals against Japan. For the first time ever both USA teams won the tournament.
