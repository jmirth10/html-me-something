            <h2>Team Travel</h2>
            <p>
                My trip started by meeting the entire team in Califorias LAX airport. The team and all the coaches met for the first time in this airport. We only had a short time to meet everyone while waiting for out flight but we would have plenty of time on our 18+ hour flight. We had almost the whole plane to ourselves. Both the men and womens teams were on the same flight with only a handful of random people. This made for a very relaxing flight as there was only 1 person to every 3 seats on the plane. After meeting everyone we were able to sleep for a few hours before ariving in Australia where it was 2 days later then when we left the US.

            <h2>The Down Under Cup</h2>
            <p>
                Our first stop was in Melbourne. The team was very excited to get their first win the morning after arriving. The rest of bracket play we only lost 1 game. We made it to the finals against Japan. For the first time ever both USA teams won the tournament.

            <h2>Time in Melbourne</h2>
            <p>
                After we won the tournament we were lucky enought to spend the night hanging out with Japan teams. It was an amazing experience talking with all of the players. Even though it was a little hard to communicate we all still had a great night. We were all together till late that night. The following day they flew us to Brisbane where we had no games or schedule.

            <h2>Time in Brisbane</h2>
            <p>
                While in Brisbane we were able to do whatever we wanted but both teams always met and ate breakfast and dinner togther. At night we went out, usually as a big group. Durring the day we tried doing some activity with others from the team. My favorite was probably traveling to one of the most dangerous beaches in the world and seeing the Gold Coast.
